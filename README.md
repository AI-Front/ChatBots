Materials for the course ""

### About the course

This course is teaching how to create ML-based chat-bots in Python.
 
At the end of the course, you will be able to prototype a multi-task bot, which can
 - chit-chat with you 
 - answer informational questions
 - perform custom skils you need (with common examples)
 

During the course, we will analyze in detail the main concepts of chat-bot development, explore NLP Python libraries and use pre-trained models for English to create a prototype chat-bot. 

### Bonus: 
we will also discuss the main modern approaches in advanced chat-bot development, including some of the recent Alexa Prize Architectures.

### Libraries: NLTK, SPaCY, DeepPavlov
